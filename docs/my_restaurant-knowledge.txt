Langflow is a visual framework for building AI applications.
It allows users to connect blocks like document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, and vector databases.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that improves Large Language Models by giving them access to external knowledge sources.
The process involves preparing data, splitting it into chunks, embedding the chunks, storing them in a vector database, and retrieving relevant chunks when a user asks a question.

Chroma is a free and open-source vector database.
It is often used with Langflow to store and retrieve document embeddings.

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture meaning.
They help the AI agent understand and compare pieces of information.
